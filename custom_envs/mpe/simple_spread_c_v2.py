# For example, consider the popular multi-agent environment called "
# Multi-Agent Particle Environments" (MPE). In MPE, there are multiple scenarios, 
# such as:

    # Simple Spread: Multiple agents need to navigate to specific landmarks while 
    # avoiding collisions with each other.
    # Simple Speaker Listener: One agent (the speaker) needs to communicate a target 
    # landmark's location to another agent (the listener) using a limited communication 
    # channel.
    # Cooperative Navigation: Multiple agents need to navigate to multiple landmarks 
    # while minimizing the distance traveled.
